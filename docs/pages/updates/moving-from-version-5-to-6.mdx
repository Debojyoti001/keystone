# Making the move from Keystone 5 → 6

By **The Keystone Team**, Published on

Early in 2021,  [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/ "https://www.thinkmill.com.au") dedicated an official team to Keystone and started focusing a huge amount of effort at getting Keystone 6 into General Availability. Now that we’ve shipped that major release with a version faster and more flexible than ever, and with a high-functioning team driving production, it’s a great time to look at making the move from Keystone 5 to 6.

## Setting a new foundation

There’s so many great changes in the new Keystone. With a TypeScript native DX, Prisma under the hood, and Next.js powering the Admin UI, we’re really excited by the foundations we’ve put in place.

Read the [full announcement](https://keystonejs.com/updates/general-availability "https://keystonejs.com/updates/general-availability"), and check out our [roadmap](https://keystonejs.com/updates/roadmap "https://keystonejs.com/updates/roadmap") to understand where we’re taking Keystone in 2022.

## Making the change to Keystone 6

With Keystone 5 in [maintenance mode](https://v5.keystonejs.com/blog/introducing-keystone-next "https://v5.keystonejs.com/blog/introducing-keystone-next"), migrating your project to Keystone 6 is a great way to take advantage of the new DX.

V6 offers a lot of features and DX improvements that weren’t possible in V5. However, better DX does come with a few limitations that V5 was not inhibited by.

Given how much has changed between the two versions, and the diversity of use cases that are in use in V5, there’s no single upgrade guide we can provide that will solve your needs.

## Help us help you ![:pray:](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/standard/a51a7674-8d5d-4495-a2d2-a67c090f5c3b/64x64/1f64f.png)

We’re working on a knowledge base to help you make the change to V6.

We’ve set up a [new discussion category](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5/discussions/new?category=upgrading-to-keystone-6 "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5/discussions/new?category=upgrading-to-keystone-6") on the Keystone 5 repo and will be seeding it with:

-   Info on some of the key differences between 5 and 6
    
-   Answers to some questions we think many of you will have
    

We also want to help in a way that’s most useful for you. After you've taken a look at the [Keystone docs](https://keystonejs.com/docs "https://keystonejs.com/docs"), and checked the existing answers, let us know:

-   Where are you getting stuck in migrating from your use case?
    
-   What other differences between V5 and V6 are hardest to grok?
    

**To get help**: just [create a new discussion topic](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/discussions/new "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/discussions/new") with info about your K5 version, and any other relevant details from your use case (deployment, DB lang, schema, etc) that we’ll need to know in order to help you.

Thanks for being part of the Keystone 5 journey, and we’re looking forward to having you on Keystone 6.

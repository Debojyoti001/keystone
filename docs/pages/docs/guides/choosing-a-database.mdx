# Choosing the right Database

Keystone supports Postgres, MySQL and SQLite as database engines for your backend. There might be different reasons why you would choose one over the other.

This page seeks to clarify some of the differences in the databases supported by Keystone.

!> **Note:** SQLite is not recommended in production unless for readonly senarios like the [embedded Keystone](../walkthroughs/embedded-mode-with-sqlite-nextjs) example

## Case Sensitivity

By default Postgres is case sensitive, while MySQL and SQLite are not case sensitive. This means when filtering and sorting the results will differ depending on database type and collation used.
When using `StringFilter`in a GraphQL query the `mode` defaults to that of the database - case sensitive for postgres, and collation dependant for MySQL, you can make a query case insensitive by using `mode: insensitive`, there is no way to make a `StringQuery` case sensitive if your database is not case sensitive.

See the [Case Sensitivity Prisma Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/case-sensitivity) for more information.

## Default Types

Prisma has different default types for each database used, for example the Keystone `text` field type using the Prisma type of `String`,
for Postgres Prisma uses the `text` column type, and for MySQL uses the `varchar(191)` column type. for more details of the field type differences
see [Primsa Schema Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-field-scalar-types).

The Keystone `text` field supports the `db.nativeType` option, allowing you to override this - [Fields API](../apis/fields). Overtime this option will be added to other field types.
